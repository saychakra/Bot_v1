# Bot_v1
Bot made using wikipedia and wolframalpha api

### Introduction
This is a basic bot, made using the two APIs suggested above. It is a fairly easy approach which is very powerful and benefecial.
Scotch.io, helped in designing the overall code. You can refer to their page, everything is the same, except the GUI implementation, which
I skipped. 

P.S. I'll probably try and integrate it into any other service, or make it more contexual with DL, later, if I can!
